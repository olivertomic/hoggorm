Quickstart
==========

hoggorm is a Python package for explorative multivariate statistics in Python. It contains 

* PCA (principal component analysis)
* PCR (principal component regression)
* PLSR (partial least squares regression)
  
  - PLSR1 for univariate responses
  - PLSR2 for multivariate responses
* matrix correlation coefficients RV and RV2.

Unlike `scikit-learn`_, which is an excellent Python machine learning package focusing on classification and prediction, hoggorm rather aims at understanding and interpretation of the variance in the data. hoggorm also contains tools for prediction.

.. _scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

.. note:: Results computed with the hoggorm package can be visualised using plotting functions implemented in the complementary `hoggormplot`_ package.

Requirements
------------
Make sure that Python 3.5 or higher is installed. A convenient way to install Python and many useful packages for scientific computing is to use the `Anaconda distribution`_.

.. _Anaconda distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

- numpy >= 1.11.3


Installation and upgrades
-------------------------

Installation
++++++++++++

Install hoggorm easily from the command line from the `PyPI - the Python Packaging Index`_. 

.. _PyPI - the Python Packaging Index: https://pypi.org/

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install hoggorm

Upgrading
+++++++++

To upgrade hoggorm from a previously installed older version execute the following from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash
        
        pip install --upgrade hoggorm


If you need more information on how to install Python packages using pip, please see the `pip documentation`_.

Testing
-------
The correctness of the results provided PCA, PCR and PLSR may be checked using the tests provided in the `tests`_ folder.

.. _tests: https://github.com/olivertomic/hoggorm/tree/master/tests


After cloning the repository to your disk, at the command line navigate to the test folder. The code below shows an example of how to run the test for PCA.

.. code-block:: bash
        
        python test_pca.py 

After testing is finished, pytest should report that none of tests failed.
