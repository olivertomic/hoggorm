## Continuous Integration

hoggorm uses [GitHub Action](https://github.com/andife/hoggorm/actions?query=workflow%3Aci-build) in combination with [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/github/andife/hoggorm?branch=hogCI) for continuous integration.

Everytime you send a Pull Request, your commit will be built and checked against the hoggorm guidelines:

1. Ensure that your code is formatted correctly by testing against the styleguides of [`flake8`](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) and [`pycodestyle`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle):

```
pycodestyle hoggorm test examples
flake8 hoggorm test examples
```

If you do not want to format your code manually, we recommend to use [`yapf`](https://github.com/google/yapf).


```
python setup.py test
```
